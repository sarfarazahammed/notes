# Product Growth

## What is Growth?
Growth is an **iterative, data-driven process** focused on building great products that add real value to users.

## Principles

### 1. Define a Single North Star Metric (NSM) and Focus on Improving It
A North Star Metric is a key measurement that best captures the core value your product delivers to customers. Examples include:

| Company    | Industry         | North Star Metric               |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Apple      | Technology       | Active devices                  |
| Amazon     | E-commerce       | Prime membership sign-ups       |
| Zoom       | Communication    | Daily Active Users (DAU)        |
| Netflix    | Entertainment    | Total subscribers               |
| Shopify    | E-commerce       | Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)  |
| Peloton    | Fitness          | Monthly Active Users (MAU)      |
| Microsoft  | Technology       | Office 365 monthly active users |
| DoorDash   | Delivery Services| Total orders                    |
| Salesforce | Cloud Computing  | Customer Satisfaction Score     |
| Airbnb     | Hospitality      | Nights booked                   |

### 2. Drive Retention Over Acquisition
Good retention indicates product-market fit and is often more sustainable than merely focusing on acquiring new users. Retention efforts ensure users continue finding value in the product.

### 3. Focus on Activation First Rather Than Onboarding
Define your **Aha Moment** to activate your product. Activation involves ensuring that users quickly realize the core value of your product.

### 4. Growth is a Game of Inches
Many small, incremental improvements can be more effective than seeking a single big win. Consistency in making small enhancements contributes to overall growth.

### 5. Increase Discoverability
Ensuring users can easily find and use features within your product is crucial. Strategies include:
- **Raise Feature Awareness:** Educate users about the full range of features available.
- **Add More Entry Points:** Design multiple access points to critical features.
- **Promote Features In-Context:** Highlight relevant features at the most appropriate times during user interaction.

### 6. Focus on Your Worst Users
Growth is often driven by reducing churn versus increasing acquisition.

### 7. Growth Begins and Ends with Data
Comprehensive logging is critical for informed decision-making and iterative improvements.
